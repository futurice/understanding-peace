# Peace tech canvases

When we design peace tech solutions there are three things that differentiate it from other technologies.

* When talking about conflicts we are usually talking local. Peace tech solutions should always consider local aspects and not expect same ideas to work in different areas.
* Instead of trying to maximise the profit, we are trying to find even a small improvement to lives of people in conflict or fragile areas. Most important thing however is to minimise the risks involved.
* For the two reasons above, we never design peace tech solution just for the user in mind. We always have to consider how our application affects the big picture.

To help you work with peace tech solutions we have designed three canvases. Their goal is to support you in the design journey and help you think through the considerations mentioned above. Canvases are design tools that offer you a framework for thinking. They themselves don't restrict you, tell you what you should do or what you shouldn't do. Rather you should consider them as checklists or starting points.

Canvases guide you on what things you should AT LEAST cover when building a responsible peace tech solution.  They combine the main issues of designing for social good with artificial intelligence. And the same restrictions apply to most social impact solutions, so these canvases can be used in versatile environments.

You can use these canvases in conjunction with other canvases. You might want to check out Futurice's open source design tools like Lean Service Creation or The Intelligence Augmented Design Toolkit.


## Peace Tech Canvas

The first canvas could also be called "Social impact -canvas". It is an overall view to your service. There's plenty of boxes that make sense to fill in only after using the other two canvases.

## Stakeholder Mapping Canvas

Stakeholder mapping is very common from other service design tools as well. However, for peace tech it has been modified somewhat. The basic idea is that for each solution there might be two stakeholder groups: those who order the service and those who benefit from it. The actual user of the service might belong to either groups. The user and the beneficiary are part of larger community and ecosystem that might affect the way they view the service and interact with it.

## Impact Canvas

This canvas is stakeholder specific. The aim is that with each canvas you'll view the solution from a specific individual's or a group's point of view. Which benefits and risks the solution might cause? How to prepare also for the potential unexpected impacts? You can have as many impact canvases for your solution as you wish.


## How to use the canvasses?

Designing peace tech solutions means navigating complex, quickly evolving, high-risk environments. The canvases offer concrete tools that help to combine the strengths of different stakeholders. Bringing together designers, technology and peace experts is a vital part of building solutions that are suitable for each local context.

The canvasses have been tested in small groups of 6-12 people with heterogenous skillsets. No matter what size your group is, taking full advantage of the canvases will require anywhere from few hours to several workshops of efficient work time. Besides the printed canvases, all you need is pens, post-its and your creativity.

The canvases will guide your design process with key questions to consider in each section. They are most useful when you already have some idea of the challenge you want to solve. Or when you have at least initially identified a need you want to address with your solution.
